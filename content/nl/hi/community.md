NumPy offers a number of communication channels available to individuals interested in using and contributing to the project.

We welcome contributions and contributors of all kinds - whether they come as contributions to code, participation in the community, opening issues and pointing out bugs, or simply sharing your work with others.

### Join the NumPy community

If you’re interested in joining the NumPy community (yay!) we recommend checking out the [NumPy Contributing guide](https://www.numpy.org/devdocs/dev/index.html). This contains information about ways to get involved, the skills that are useful for each project area or activity, how to get started working on code, documentation or the website, and other ways that you can become a part of the NumPy community.

### Participate online

NumPy also has a number of online communication channels to help keep in touch.

As you interact with others in the NumPy community, remember that we have a strong commitment to being an open, inclusive, and positive community. Please read the [NumPy Code of Conduct](https://www.numpy.org/devdocs/dev/conduct/code_of_conduct.html) for guidance on how to interact with others in a way that makes the community thrive.

Below is a short list of communication channels and GitHub repositories where you can get involved. We always welcome participation in the NumPy community.

TODO:

- GitHub org and main repositories
- The numpy-discussion mailing list
- Stack Overflow for usage questions
- Gitter `numpy/numpy`: a real-time chatroom where users and community members help each other out.
- Contributing guide
- Slack for a real-time chatroom to ask questions about contributing to NumPy.
