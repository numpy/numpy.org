title: Installing NumPy

The only prerequisite for NumPy is Python itself. If you don't have Python yet, we recommend you use the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution) - it includes Python, NumPy, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science.

NumPy can be installed with `conda`, with `pip`, or with a package manager on macOS and Linux. For more detailed instructions, consult the [installation guide](to_be_added_to_the_docs).

## conda

If you use `conda`, you can install it with:

```bash
conda install numpy
```

or with:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge numpy
```

## pip

If you use `pip`, you can install it with:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

If your Python came with your operating system, we advise you either install a separate Python or use:

```bash
pip install numpy --user
```
