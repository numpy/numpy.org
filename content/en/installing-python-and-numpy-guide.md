Installing and managing packages in Python land is complicated, there are a
number of alternative solutions for most tasks. This guide tries to give the
reader a sense of the best (or most popular) solutions, and give clear
recommendations. It focuses on users of Python, NumPy and the PyData (or
numerical computing) stack on common operating systems and hardware.

## Recommendations

We'll start with recommendations based on the experience level of the user and
operating system of interest. If you're in between "beginning" and "advanced",
please go with "beginning" if you want to keep things simple, and with
"advanced" if you want to work according to best practices that go a longer way
in the future.

### Beginning users

On all of Windows, macOS and Linux:

- Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) (it install all
  packages you need and all other tools mentioned below).
- For writing and executing code, use notebooks in
  [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) for
  exploratory and interactive computing, and
  [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  for writing scripts and packages.
- Use [Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/) to
  manage your packages and start JupyterLab, Spyder or Visual Studio Code.


### Advanced users

#### Windows or macOS

- Install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
- Keep the `base` conda environment minimal, and use one or more
  [conda environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#)
  to install the package you need for the task or project you're working on.
- Unless you're fine with only the packages in the `defaults` channel, make `conda-forge`
  your default channel via [setting the channel priority](https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/introduction.html#how-can-i-install-packages-from-conda-forge).


#### Linux

If you're fine with slightly outdated packages and prefer stability over being
able to use the latest versions of libraries:
- use your OS package manager for as much as possible (Python itself, NumPy and
  other libraries)
- install packages not provided by your package manager with `pip install somepackage --user`

If you use a GPU:
- Install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
- Keep the `base` conda environment minimal, and use one or more
  [conda environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#)
  to install the package you need for the task or project you're working on.
- Use the `defaults` conda channel (`conda-forge` doesn't have good support for
  GPU packages yet)

Otherwise:
- Install [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge)
- Keep the `base` conda environment minimal, and use one or more
  [conda environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#)
  to install the package you need for the task or project you're working on.


#### Alternative if you prefer pip/PyPI

For users who know, from personal preference or reading about the main
differences between Conda and Pip below, they prefer a pip/PyPI-based solution,
we recommend:
- Install Python from, for example, [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/),
  [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or your Linux package manager
- Use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as the most well-maintained tool
  that provides a dependency resolver and environment management capabilities
  in a similar fashion as Conda does.


## Python package management

Managing packages is a challenging problem, and as a result there are lots of
tools. For web and general purpose Python development there's a whole
[host of tools](https://packaging.python.org/guides/tool-recommendations/)
complementary with Pip. For high-performance computing (HPC),
[Spack](https://github.com/spack/spack) is worth considering. For most NumPy
users though, [Conda](https://conda.io/en/latest/) and
[Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) are the two most popular tools.


### Pip & Conda

The two main tools that install Python packages are `pip` and `conda`. Their
functionality partially overlaps (e.g. both can install `numpy`), however they
can also work together. We'll discuss the major differences between Pip and
Conda here - this is important to understand if you want to manage packages
effectively.

The first difference is that Conda is cross-language and it can install Python,
while Pip is installed for a particular Python on your system and install other
packages to that same Python install only. This also means Conda can install
non-Python libraries and tools you may need (e.g. compilers, CUDA, HDF5) while
Pip can't.

The second difference is that Pip install from the Python Packaging Index
(PyPI) while Conda installs from its own channels (typically "defaults" or
"conda-forge"). PyPI is the largest collection of packages by far, however all
popular packages are available for Conda as well.

The third difference is that Pip does not have a _dependency resolver_ (this is
expecting to change next year though) while Conda does. For simple cases (e.g.
you just want NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Scikit-learn and a few other
packages) that doesn't matter, however for complicated cases Conda can be
expected to do a better job keeping everything working well together.  The flip
side of that coin is that installing with Pip is typically a _lot_ faster than
installing with Conda.

The fourth difference is that Conda is an integrated solution for managing
packages, dependencies and environments, while with Pip you may need another
tool (there's many!) for dealing with environments or complex dependencies.


### Reproducible installs

Making the installation of all the packages your analysis, library or
application depends on reproducible is important. Sounds obvious, yet most
users don't think about doing this (at least until it's too late).

The problem with Python packaging is that sooner or later, something will
break. It's not often this bad,

{{< figure src="/images/content_images/python_environment_xkcd.png"
           alt="Python Environment XKCD image"
           link="https://xkcd.com/1987/"
           width="400"
           attr="_XKCD illustration - Python environment degradation_">}}

but it does degrade over time. Hence, it's important to be able to delete and
reconstruct the set of packages you have installed.

Best practice is to use a different environment per project you're working on,
and record at least the names (and preferably versions) of the packages you
directly depend on in a static metadata file. Each packaging tool has its own
metadata format for this:
- Conda: [conda environments and environment.yml](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#)
- Pip: [virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) and
  [requirements.txt](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/#requirements-files)
- Poetry: [virtual environments and pyproject.toml](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/)

Sometimes it's too much overhead to create and switch between new environments
for small tasks. In that case we encourage you to not install too many packages
into your base environment, and keep track of versions of packages some other
way (e.g. comments inside files, or printing `numpy.__version__` after
importing it in notebooks).


## NumPy packages & accelerated linear algebra libraries

NumPy doesn't depend on any other Python packages, however it does depend on an
accelerated linear algebra library - typically
[Intel MKL](https://software.intel.com/en-us/mkl) or
[OpenBLAS](https://www.openblas.net/).  The user doesn't have to worry about
installing those, but it may still be important to understand how the packaging
is done and how that affects performance and behavior the user sees.

The NumPy wheels on PyPI, which is what Pip installs, are built with OpenBLAS.
The OpenBLAS libraries are shipped within the wheels itself. This makes those
wheels larger, and if the user installs (for example) SciPy as well, she will
now have two copies of OpenBLAS on disk.

In the Conda defaults channel, NumPy is built against Intel MKL. MKL is a
separate package that will be installed in the user's environment when she
installs NumPy. That MKL package is a lot larger than OpenBLAS, several hundred
MB. MKL is typically a little faster and more robust than OpenBLAS.

In the conda-forge channel, NumPy is built against a dummy "BLAS" package. When
the user install NumPy from conda-forge, that BLAS package then gets installed
together with the actual library - this defaults to OpenBLAS, but it can also
be MKL (from the defaults channel), or even
[BLIS](https://github.com/flame/blis) or reference BLAS.

Besides install sizes, performance and robustness, there are two more things to
consider:
- Intel MKL is not open source. For normal use this is not a problem, but if
  the user needs to redistribute an application built with NumPy, this could be
  an issue.
- Both MKL and OpenBLAS will use multi-threading for function calls like
  `np.dot`, with the number of threads being determined by both a build-time
  option and an environment variable. Often all CPU cores will be used. This is
  sometimes unexpected for users; NumPy itself doesn't auto-parallelize any
  function calls. It can also be harmful for performance, for example when
  using another level of parallelization manually or with, e.g. Dask or
  scikit-learn functionality.
