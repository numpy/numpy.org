We would like to make it easy for you to include the NumPy project identity in your next academic paper, course materials, or presentation. 

You will find several high-resolution versions of the NumPy logo [here](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/tree/main/branding/logo). Note that by using the numpy.org resources, you accept the [NumPy Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct).
