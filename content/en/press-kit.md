We would like to make it easy for you to include the NumPy brand identity in your next academic paper, course materials or presentation. 

You will find a high resolution logo of NumPy [here](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/tree/master/branding/icons).
Note that by using the numpy.org resources, you accept the [NumPy Code of Conduct](https://numpy.org/code-of-conduct).
