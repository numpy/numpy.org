The only prerequisite for NumPy is Python itself. If you don't have Python yet and want the simplest way to get started, we recommend you use the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution) - it includes Python, NumPy, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science.

NumPy can be installed with `conda`, with `pip`, or with a package manager on macOS and Linux. For more detailed instructions, consult our [Python and NumPy installation guide](/installing-python-and-numpy-guide).

## conda

If you use `conda`, you can install it with:

```bash
conda install numpy
```

## pip

If you use `pip`, you can install it with:

```bash
pip install numpy
```
