title: Installing NumPy
sidebar: false
---

The only prerequisite for installing NumPy is Python itself. If you don't have
Python yet and want the simplest way to get started, we recommend you use the
[Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution) - it includes
Python, NumPy, and many other commonly used packages for scientific computing
and data science.

NumPy can be installed with `conda`, with `pip`, with a package manager on
macOS and Linux, or [from source](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/building.html).
For more detailed instructions, consult our [Python and NumPy
installation guide](#python-numpy-install-guide) below.

**CONDA**

If you use `conda`, you can install NumPy from the `defaults` or `conda-forge`
channels:

```bash
# Best practice, use an environment rather than install in the base env
conda create -n my-env
conda activate my-env
# If you want to install from conda-forge
conda config --env --add channels conda-forge
# The actual install command
conda install numpy
```

**PIP**

If you use `pip`, you can install NumPy with:

```bash
pip install numpy
```
Also when using pip, it's good practice to use a virtual environment -
see  [Reproducible Installs](#reproducible-installs) below for why, and
[this guide](https://dev.to/bowmanjd/python-tools-for-managing-virtual-environments-3bko#howto)
for details on using virtual environments.

# Python and NumPy installation guide

Installing and managing packages in Python is complicated, there are a
number of alternative solutions for most tasks. This guide tries to give the
reader a sense of the best (or most popular) solutions, and give clear
recommendations. It focuses on users of Python, NumPy, and the PyData (or
numerical computing) stack on common operating systems and hardware.

## Recommendations

We'll start with recommendations based on the user's experience level and
operating system of interest. If you're in between "beginning" and "advanced",
please go with "beginning" if you want to keep things simple, and with
"advanced" if you want to work according to best practices that go a longer way
in the future.

### Beginning users

On all of Windows, macOS, and Linux:

- Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) (it installs all
  packages you need and all other tools mentioned below).
- For writing and executing code, use notebooks in
  [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) for
  exploratory and interactive computing, and
  [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  for writing scripts and packages.
- Use [Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/) to
  manage your packages and start JupyterLab, Spyder, or Visual Studio Code.


### Advanced users

#### Windows or macOS

- Install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
- Keep the `base` conda environment minimal, and use one or more
  [conda environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#)
  to install the package you need for the task or project you're working on.
- Unless you're fine with only the packages in the `defaults` channel, make `conda-forge`
  your default channel via [setting the channel priority](https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/introduction.html#how-can-i-install-packages-from-conda-forge).


#### Linux

If you're fine with slightly outdated packages and prefer stability over being
able to use the latest versions of libraries:
- Use your OS package manager for as much as possible (Python itself, NumPy, and
  other libraries).
- Install packages not provided by your package manager with `pip install somepackage --user`.

If you use a GPU:
- Install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
- Keep the `base` conda environment minimal, and use one or more
  [conda environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#)
  to install the package you need for the task or project you're working on.
- Use the `defaults` conda channel (`conda-forge` doesn't have good support for
  GPU packages yet).

Otherwise:
- Install [Miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge).
- Keep the `base` conda environment minimal, and use one or more
  [conda environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#)
  to install the package you need for the task or project you're working on.


#### Alternative if you prefer pip/PyPI

For users who know, from personal preference or reading about the main
differences between conda and pip below, they prefer a pip/PyPI-based solution,
we recommend:
- Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/),
  [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), or your Linux package manager.
- Use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as the most well-maintained tool
  that provides a dependency resolver and environment management capabilities
  in a similar fashion as conda does.


## Python package management

Managing packages is a challenging problem, and, as a result, there are lots of
tools. For web and general purpose Python development there's a whole
[host of tools](https://packaging.python.org/guides/tool-recommendations/)
complementary with pip. For high-performance computing (HPC),
[Spack](https://github.com/spack/spack) is worth considering. For most NumPy
users though, [conda](https://conda.io/en/latest/) and
[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) are the two most popular tools.


### Pip & conda

The two main tools that install Python packages are `pip` and `conda`. Their
functionality partially overlaps (e.g. both can install `numpy`), however, they
can also work together. We'll discuss the major differences between pip and
conda here - this is important to understand if you want to manage packages
effectively.

The first difference is that conda is cross-language and it can install Python,
while pip is installed for a particular Python on your system and installs other
packages to that same Python install only. This also means conda can install
non-Python libraries and tools you may need (e.g. compilers, CUDA, HDF5), while
pip can't.

The second difference is that pip installs from the Python Packaging Index
(PyPI), while conda installs from its own channels (typically "defaults" or
"conda-forge"). PyPI is the largest collection of packages by far, however, all
popular packages are available for conda as well.

The third difference is that conda is an integrated solution for managing
packages, dependencies and environments, while with pip you may need another
tool (there are many!) for dealing with environments or complex dependencies.


### Reproducible installs

As libraries get updated, results from running your code can change, or your
code can break completely. It's important to be able to reconstruct the set
of packages and versions you're using. Best practice is to:

1. use a different environment per project you're working on,
2. record package names and versions using your package installer;
   each has its own metadata format for this:
   - Conda: [conda environments and environment.yml](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#)
   - Pip: [virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) and
  [requirements.txt](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/#requirements-files)
   - Poetry: [virtual environments and pyproject.toml](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/)



## NumPy packages & accelerated linear algebra libraries

NumPy doesn't depend on any other Python packages, however, it does depend on an
accelerated linear algebra library - typically
[Intel MKL](https://software.intel.com/en-us/mkl) or
[OpenBLAS](https://www.openblas.net/). Users don't have to worry about
installing those (they're automatically included in all NumPy install methods).
Power users may still want to know the details, because the used BLAS can
affect performance, behavior and size on disk:

- The NumPy wheels on PyPI, which is what pip installs, are built with OpenBLAS.
  The OpenBLAS libraries are included in the wheel. This makes the wheel
  larger, and if a user installs (for example) SciPy as well, they will now
  have two copies of OpenBLAS on disk.

- In the conda defaults channel, NumPy is built against Intel MKL. MKL is a
  separate package that will be installed in the users' environment when they
  install NumPy.

- In the conda-forge channel, NumPy is built against a dummy "BLAS" package. When
  a user installs NumPy from conda-forge, that BLAS package then gets installed
  together with the actual library - this defaults to OpenBLAS, but it can also
  be MKL (from the defaults channel), or even
  [BLIS](https://github.com/flame/blis) or reference BLAS.

- The MKL package is a lot larger than OpenBLAS, it's about 700 MB on disk
  while OpenBLAS is about 30 MB.

- MKL is typically a little faster and more robust than OpenBLAS.

Besides install sizes, performance and robustness, there are two more things to
consider:

- Intel MKL is not open source. For normal use this is not a problem, but if
  a user needs to redistribute an application built with NumPy, this could be
  an issue.
- Both MKL and OpenBLAS will use multi-threading for function calls like
  `np.dot`, with the number of threads being determined by both a build-time
  option and an environment variable. Often all CPU cores will be used. This is
  sometimes unexpected for users; NumPy itself doesn't auto-parallelize any
  function calls. It typically yields better performance, but can also be
  harmful - for example when using another level of parallelization with Dask,
  scikit-learn or multiprocessing.


## Troubleshooting

If your installation fails with the message below, see [Troubleshooting
ImportError](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/troubleshooting-importerror.html).

```
IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ THIS FOR ADVICE ON HOW TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE!

Importing the numpy c-extensions failed. This error can happen for
different reasons, often due to issues with your setup.
