## About Gravitational Waves and [LIGO](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu)

[Gravitational waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_observation_of_gravitational_waves) are ripples in the fabric of spacetime, generated by cataclysmic events in the universe such as collision and merging of two black holes, coalescing binary stars, supernovae or [compact binaries](https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~hsr/researchcb-en.html). Observing GW can not only help in studying gravity but also in understanding some of the obscure phenomena in the distant universe and its impact. Two of the most recent events in the context of gravitaional waves are the focus of this case study:

* [GW observations from LIGO/Virgo GW150914](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_observation_of_gravitational_waves): The original discovery of gravitational waves from a binary black hole merger 
* [GW observations from LiGO/Virgo * GW170817](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW170817): The first direct detection of neutron start mergers 

The [Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory
(LIGO)](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu) was designed to open the field of
gravitational-wave astrophysics through the direct detection of gravitational
waves predicted by Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity. It comprises two
widely-separated interferometers within the United States—one in Hanford,
Washington and the other in Livingston, Louisiana—operated in unison to detect
gravitational waves. Each of them has multi-kilometer-scale gravitational wave
detectors that use laser interferometry.  The LIGO Scientific Collaboration
(LSC), is a group of more than 1000 scientists from universities around the
United States and in 14 other countries supported by more than 90 universities
and research institutes; approximately 250 students actively contributing to the
collaboration. LIGO discovery GW150914 is the first observation that is
significant in being the first observation both confirming the existence of
gravitational waves as well as proves the ability to directly measure them. 

Gravitational waves allow scientists to observe and study the universe in a
brand new way, ushering in the era of gravitational wave astronomy.

### Key Objectives

* Though its [mission](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/what-is-ligo) is to
  detect gravitational waves from some of the most violent and energetic
processes in the Universe, the data LIGO collects may have far-reaching effects
on many areas of physics including gravitation, relativity, astrophysics,
cosmology, particle physics, and nuclear physics.
* Crunch observed data via numerical relativity computations that involves
  complex maths in order to discern signal from noise, filter out relevant
signal and statistically estimate significance of observed data 
* Data visualization so that the binary / numerical results can be
  comprehended.
 

### The Challenges 

* **Computation**

    Gravitational Waves are hard to detect as they produce a very small effect
and have tiny interaction with matter.  Processing and analyzing all of LIGO's
data requires a vast computing infrastructure.After taking care of noise, which
is billions of times of the signal, there is still very complex relativity
equations and huge amounts of data which present a computational challenge:
[O(10^7) CPU hrs needed for binary merger
analyses](https://youtu.be/7mcHknWWzNI) spread on 6 dedicated LIGO clusters 

* **Data Deluge**

    As observational devices become more sensitive and reliable, the challenges
posed by data deluge and finding a needle in a haystack rise multi-fold.  LIGO
generates terabytes of data every day! Making sense of this data requires an
enormous effort for each and every detection. For example, the signals being
collected by LIGO must be matched by supercomputers against hundreds of
thousands of templates of possible gravitational-wave signatures. 

* **Visualization**

    Once the obstacles related to understanding Einstein’s equations well enough
to solve them using supercomputers are taken care of, the next big challenge was
making data comprehensible to the human brain. Simulation modeling as well as
signal detection requires effective visualization techniques.  Visualization
also plays a role in lending more credibility to numerical relativity in the
eyes of pure science aficionados, who did not give enough importance to
numerical relativity until imaging and simulations made it easier to comprehend
results for a larger audience.  Speed of complex computations and rendering,
re-rendering images and simulations using latest experimental inputs and
insights can be a time consuming activity that challenges researchers in this
domain.

## NumPy’s Role in the detection of Gravitational Waves
	
Gravitational waves emitted from the merger cannot be computed using any
technique except brute force numerical relativity using supercomputers.  The
amount of data LIGO collects is as incomprehensibly large and requires careful
processing like any other data science problem.  Although it is technologically
more challenging to achieve the requisite sensitivity for capturing
gravitaional waves and is way harder than dealing with large scale data, yet
the latter is complex enough to require numerical processing skills of several
Python tools including
[NumPy](https://towardsdatascience.com/2020-how-a-i-could-help-astronomers-sorting-big-data-811571705707).

NumPy, the standard numerical analysis package for Python,  was utilized by the
software used for various tasks performed during the GW detection project at
LIGO. NumPy helped in solving complex maths and data manipulation at high speed.
Here are some examples:

* [Signal Processing](https://www.uv.es/virgogroup/Denoising_ROF.html): Glitch
  detection,  [Noise identification and Data
Characterization](https://ep2016.europython.eu/media/conference/slides/pyhton-in-gravitational-waves-research-communities.pdf)
(NumPy, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, pandas, pyCharm )
* GW data analysis
  such as [GwPy](https://gwpy.github.io/docs/stable/overview.html) and
[PyCBC](https://pycbc.org) uses NumPy and AstroPy under the hood for providing
object based interfaces to utilities, tools and methods for studying data from
gravitational-wave detectors. Both GwPy and pycbc libraries rely on NumPy for
analysis of the "chirp" signal. For example, in pycbc, the time series data are
stored in ndarrays and scipy.signal, which operates on NumPy arrays.
* Data retrieval: Deciding which data can be analyzed, figuring out whether it
  contains a signal - needle in a haystack
* Statistical analysis: estimate the statistical significance of observational
  data, estimating the signal parameters (e.g. masses of stars, spin velocity,
and distance) by comparison with a model.
* Visualization of data
  - Time series
  - Spectrograms
* Compute Correlations Key [Software](https://github.com/lscsoft) developed in

## Summary

GW detection has enabled researchers to discover entirely unexpected phenomena
while providing new insight into many of the most profound astrophysical
phenomena known. Number crunching and data visualization is a crucial step that
helps scientists gain insights into data gathered from the scientific
observations and understand the results. The computations are complex and cannot
be comprehended by humans unless it is visualized using computer simulations
that are fed with the real observed data and analysis.  NumPy along with other
Python packages such as matplotlib, pandas and scikit-learn is [enabling
researchers](https://www.gw-openscience.org/events/GW150914/) to answer complex
questions and discover new horizons in our understanding of the universe.
