## About [Gravitational Waves](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2017/10/what-are-gravitational-waves-ligo-astronomy-science/) and [LIGO](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu)

Gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of space and time, generated by
cataclysmic events in the universe such as collision and merging of two black
holes or coalescing binary stars or supernovae. Observing GW can not only help
in studying gravity but also in understanding some of the obscure phenomena in
the distant universe and its impact.

The [Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO)](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu)
was designed to open the field of gravitational-wave astrophysics through the
direct detection of gravitational waves predicted by Einstein’s General Theory
of Relativity. It comprises two widely-separated interferometers within the
United States—one in Hanford, Washington and the other in Livingston,
Louisiana—operated in unison to detect gravitational waves. Each of them has
multi-kilometer-scale gravitational wave detectors that use laser
interferometry.  The LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC), is a group of more
than 1000 scientists from universities around the United States and in 14
other countries supported by more than 90 universities and research institutes;
approximately 250 students actively contributing to the collaboration. The new
LIGO discovery is the first observation of gravitational waves themselves,
made by measuring the tiny disturbances the waves make to space and time as
they pass through the earth.  It has opened up new astrophysical frontiers
that explore the warped side of the universe—objects and phenomena that are
made from warped spacetime.


### Key Objectives

* Though its [mission](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/page/what-is-ligo) is to
  detect gravitational waves from some of the most violent and energetic
  processes in the Universe, the data LIGO collects may have far-reaching
  effects on many areas of physics including gravitation, relativity,
  astrophysics, cosmology, particle physics, and nuclear physics.
* Crunch observed data via numerical relativity computations that involves
  complex maths in order to discern signal from noise, filter out relevant
  signal and statistically estimate significance of observed data
* Data visualization so that the binary / numerical results can be
  comprehended.



### The Challenges

* **Computation**

    Gravitational Waves are hard to detect as they produce a very small effect
    and have tiny interaction with matter.  Processing and analyzing all of
    LIGO's data requires a vast computing infrastructure.After taking care of
    noise, which is billions of times of the signal, there is still very
    complex relativity equations and huge amounts of data which present a
    computational challenge:
    [O(10^7) CPU hrs needed for binary merger analyses](https://youtu.be/7mcHknWWzNI)
    spread on 6 dedicated LIGO clusters

* **Data Deluge**

    As observational devices become more sensitive and reliable, the challenges
    posed by data deluge and finding a needle in a haystack rise multi-fold.
    LIGO generates terabytes of data every day! Making sense of this data
    requires an enormous effort for each and every detection. For example, the
    signals being collected by LIGO must be matched by supercomputers against
    hundreds of thousands of templates of possible gravitational-wave signatures.

* **Visualization**

    Once the obstacles related to understanding Einstein’s equations well
    enough to solve them using supercomputers are taken care of, the next big
    challenge was making data comprehensible to the human brain. Simulation
    modeling as well as  signal detection requires effective visualization
    techniques.  Visualization also plays a role in lending more credibility
    to numerical relativity in the eyes of pure science aficionados, who did
    not give enough importance to numerical relativity until imaging and
    simulations made it easier to comprehend results for a larger audience.
    Speed of complex computations and rendering, re-rendering images and
    simulations using latest experimental inputs and insights can be a time
    consuming activity that challenges researchers in this domain.

## NumPy’s Role in the detection of Gravitational Waves

Gravitational waves emitted from the merger cannot be computed using any
technique except brute force numerical relativity using supercomputers.
The amount of data LIGO collects is as incomprehensibly large as gravitational
wave signals are small.

NumPy, the standard numerical analysis package for Python,  was utilized by
the software used for various tasks performed during the GW detection project
at LIGO. NumPy helped in solving complex maths and data manipulation at high
speed.  Here are some examples:

* [Signal Processing](https://www.uv.es/virgogroup/Denoising_ROF.html): Glitch
  detection,  [Noise identification and Data Characterization](https://ep2016.europython.eu/media/conference/slides/pyhton-in-gravitational-waves-research-communities.pdf)
  (NumPy, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, pandas, pyCharm )
* Data retrieval: Deciding which data can be analyzed, figuring out whether it
  contains a signal - needle in a haystack
* Statistical analysis: estimate the statistical significance of observational
  data, estimating the signal parameters (e.g. masses of stars, spin velocity,
  and distance) by comparison with a model.
* Visualization of data
  - Time series
  - Spectrograms
* Compute Correlations
* Key [Software](https://github.com/lscsoft) developed in GW data analysis
  such as [GwPy](https://gwpy.github.io/docs/stable/overview.html) and
  [PyCBC](https://pycbc.org) uses NumPy and AstroPy under the hood for
  providing object based interfaces to utilities, tools and methods for
  studying data from gravitational-wave detectors.


## Summary

GW detection has enabled researchers to discover entirely unexpected phenomena
while providing new insight into many of the most profound astrophysical
phenomena known. Number crunching and data visualization is a crucial step
that helps scientists gain insights into data gathered from the scientific
observations and understand the results. The computations are complex and
cannot be comprehended by humans unless it is visualized using computer
simulations that are fed with the real observed data and analysis.  NumPy
along with other Python packages such as matplotlib, pandas and scikit-learn
is [enabling researchers](https://www.gw-openscience.org/events/GW150914/) to
answer complex questions and discover new horizons in our understanding of the
universe.
