The NumPy project welcomes your expertise and enthusiasm!
Your choices aren't limited to programming, as you can
see below there are many areas where we need **your** help.

If you're unsure where to start or how your skills fit in, _reach out!_ You
can ask on the [mailing
list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/numpy-discussion) or
[GitHub](http://github.com/numpy/numpy) (open an
[issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues) or comment on a relevant
issue).

Those are our preferred channels (open source is open by nature), but
if you prefer to talk privately, contact our community coordinators at
<numpy-team@googlegroups.com> or on [Slack](https://numpy-team.slack.com)
(write  <numpy-team@googlegroups.com> for an invite).

We also have a biweekly _community call_, details of which are announced on
the [mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/numpy-discussion).
You are very welcome to join.
If you are new to contributing to open source, we also highly recommend reading
[this guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).

Our community aspires to treat everyone equally and to value all
contributions. We have a [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct) to foster an open
and welcoming environment.

### Writing code

Programmers, this
[guide](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/index.html#development-process-summary)
explains how to contribute to the NumPy codebase.
<br>Check out also our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCK6zCrcN3GXBUUzDr9L4__LnXZVtaIzS) for additional advice.


### Reviewing pull requests
The project has more than 250 open pull requests -- meaning many potential
improvements and many open-source contributors waiting for feedback. If you're
a developer who knows NumPy, you can help even if you're not familiar with the
codebase. You can:
* summarize a long-running discussion
* triage documentation PRs
* test proposed changes


### Developing educational materials

NumPy's [User Guide](https://numpy.org/devdocs) is undergoing rehabilitation.
We're in need of new tutorials, how-to's, and deep-dive explanations, and the
site needs restructuring. Opportunities aren't limited to writers. We'd also
welcome worked examples, notebooks, and videos. [NEP 44 — Restructuring the
NumPyDocumentation](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0044-restructuring-numpy-docs.html)
lays out our ideas -- and you may have others.


### Issue triaging

The [NumPy issue tracker](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues) has a _lot_
of open issues. Some are no longer valid, some should be prioritized, and some
would make good issues for new contributors.  You can:

* check if older bugs are still present
* find duplicate issues and link related ones
* add good self-contained reproducers to issues
* label issues correctly (this requires triage rights -- just ask)

Please just dive in.


### Website development

We've just revamped our website, but we're far from done. If you love web
development, these
[issues](https://github.com/numpy/numpy.org/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adesign)
list some of our unmet needs -- and feel free to share your own ideas.


### Graphic design

We can barely begin to list the contributions a graphic designer can make here.
Our docs are parched for illustration; our growing website craves images --
opportunities abound.


### Translating website content

We plan multiple translations of [numpy.org](https://numpy.org) to make NumPy
accessible to users in their native language. Volunteer translators are at the heart
of this effort.  See
[here](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0028-website-redesign.html#translation-multilingual-i18n)
for background; comment on [this GitHub
issue](https://github.com/numpy/numpy.org/issues/55) to sign up.


### Community coordination and outreach

Through community contact we share our work more widely and learn where we're
falling short. We're eager to get more people involved in efforts like our
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/numpy_team) account, organizing NumPy [code
sprints](https://scisprints.github.io/), a newsletter, and perhaps a blog.

### Fundraising

NumPy was all-volunteer for many years, but as its importance grew it became
clear that to ensure stability and growth we'd need financial support. [This
SciPy'19 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBTJD_FDVjU) explains how much
difference that support has made. Like all the nonprofit world, we're
constantly searching for grants, sponsorships, and other kinds of support. We
have a number of ideas and of course we welcome more. Fundraising is a scarce
skill here -- we'd appreciate your help.
