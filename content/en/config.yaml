  keyfeatures:
    features:
    - title: Powerful N-dimensional arrays
      text:  Fast and versatile, the NumPy vectorization, indexing, and broadcasting concepts are the de-facto standards of array computing today.
    - title: Numerical computing tools
      text: NumPy offers comprehensive mathematical functions, random number generators, linear algebra routines, Fourier transforms, and more.
    - title: Interoperable
      text: NumPy supports a wide range of hardware and computing platforms, and plays well with distributed, GPU, and sparse array libraries.
    - title: Performant
      text: The core of NumPy is well-optimized C code. Enjoy the flexibility of Python with the speed of compiled code.
    - title: Easy to use
      text: NumPy's high level syntax makes it accessible and productive for programmers from any background or experience level.
    - title: Open source
      text: Distributed under a liberal [BSD license](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/main/LICENSE.txt), NumPy is developed and maintained [publicly on GitHub](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) by a vibrant, responsive, and diverse [community](/community).
