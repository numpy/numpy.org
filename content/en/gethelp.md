User questions are best asked on a public community site. The largest such site
is Stack Overflow.  There are also smaller active groups of users that ask and
answer questions on IRC, Gitter, and Reddit.

These forums are not moderated by the NumPy team at the moment (we wish we
could, the volume is just a little overwhelming!). We encourage everyone to
engage patiently and respectfully in all these forums, in the spirit of the
[NumPy Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct).


_For NumPy development related matters (e.g. bug reports), please
see [Community](/community)._
