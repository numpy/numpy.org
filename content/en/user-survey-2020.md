In mid-2020, the NumPy Survey Team in partnership with students and faculty from a Masterâ€™s course in Survey Methodology jointly hosted by the University of Michigan and the University of Maryland conducted the first official NumPy Community Survey. We invited all NumPy stakeholders to share about their experiences with NumPy and voice their thoughts about the future of the project. Over 1,200 users from 75 countries participated to help us map out a landscape of the NumPy community.
