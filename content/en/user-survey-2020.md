In 2020, the NumPy survey team in partnership with students and faculty from a Masterâ€™s course in Survey Methodology jointly hosted by the University of Michigan and the University of Maryland conducted the first official NumPy community survey. Over 1,200 users from 75 countries participated to help us map out a landscape of the NumPy community and voiced their thoughts about the future of the project.
