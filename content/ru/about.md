NumPy is an open source project that enables numerical computing with Python. It was created in 2005 building on the early work of the Numeric and Numarray libraries. NumPy will always be 100% open source software and free for all to use. It is released under the liberal terms of the [modified BSD license](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/main/LICENSE.txt).

NumPy is developed in the open on GitHub, through the consensus of the NumPy and wider scientific Python community. For more information on our governance approach, please see our [Governance Document](https://www.numpy.org/devdocs/dev/governance/index.html).
