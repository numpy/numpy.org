**Development issues:** For NumPy development-related matters (e.g., bug reports), please
see [Community](/community).

**User questions:** The best way to get help is to post your question to a site
like [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/numpy) or
[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Numpy/). We wish we could keep an eye on
these sites, or answer questions directly, but the volume is a little
overwhelming!

### [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/numpy)

A forum for asking usage questions, e.g. "How do I do X in NumPy?‚Äù. Please [use the `#numpy` tag](https://stackoverflow.com/help/tagging)
