_Some information about the NumPy project and community_

NumPy is an open source project aiming to enable numerical computing with Python. It was created in 2005, building on early work of the Numerical and Numarray libraries. NumPy will always be 100% open-source software, free for all to use and released under the liberal terms of the [modified BSD license](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).

NumPy is developed in the open on GitHub, through the consensus of the NumPy and wider scientific Python community. For more information on our governance approach, please see our [Governance Document](https://www.numpy.org/devdocs/dev/governance/index.html).
