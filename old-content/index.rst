NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
It contains among other things:

- a powerful N-dimensional array object
- sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
- tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
- useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient
multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be
defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide
variety of databases.

NumPy is licensed under the :ref:`BSD license <license>`, enabling reuse with
few restrictions.

Getting Started
---------------

To install NumPy, we strongly recommend using a
*scientific Python distribution*.  See
`Installing the SciPy Stack <https://www.scipy.org/install.html>`__ for
details.

Many high quality online tutorials, courses, and books are available to get
started with NumPy. For a quick introduction to NumPy we provide the
`NumPy Tutorial <https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html>`__. We
also recommend the `SciPy Lecture Notes <https://scipy-lectures.org>`__ for a
broader introduction to the scientific Python ecosystem.

For more information on the SciPy Stack (for which NumPy provides the
fundamental array data structure), see `scipy.org <https://www.scipy.org/>`__.

Documentation
-------------

The most up-to-date NumPy documentation can be found at
`Latest (development) version <https://numpy.org/devdocs>`__.
It includes a user guide, full reference documentation, a developer guide, meta
information, and "NumPy Enhancement Proposals" (which include the NumPy Roadmap
and detailed plans for major new features).

A complete archive of documentation for all NumPy releases (minor versions; bug
fix releases don't contain significant documentation changes) since 2009 can be
found at https://numpy.org/doc/

NumPy Enhancement Proposals (NEPs) can be found at https://numpy.org/neps

Support NumPy
-------------

If you have found NumPy to be useful in your work, research or company, please
consider making a donation to the project commensurate with your resources. Any
amount helps! All donations will be used strictly to fund the development of
NumPy’s open source software, documentation and community.

NumPy is a Sponsored Project of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit charity in the
United States. NumFOCUS provides NumPy with fiscal, legal, and administrative
support to help ensure the health and sustainability of the project. Visit
`numfocus.org <https://numfocus.org>`__ for more information.

Donations to NumPy are managed by NumFOCUS. For donors in the United States,
your gift is tax-deductible to the extent provided by law. As with any
donation, you should consult with your tax adviser about your particular tax
situation.

NumPy's `Steering Council <https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/governance/index.html>`__
will make the decisions on how to best use any funds received.  Technical and
infrastructure priorities are documented on the
`NumPy Roadmap <https://numpy.org/neps/roadmap.html>`__.
