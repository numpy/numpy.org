                <b>Machine learning</b> (ML) enables computers to learn using
                data, without having to be explicitly programmed.
                <b>NumPy</b> is the foundation of all data pre-processing
                that happens in the implementation of several ML Algorithms.

                Python’s rich machine language and deep learning ecosystem
                provides powerful tools such as
                <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">Scikit-learn</a>
                that is built on top of NumPy and
                <a href="https://www.scipy.org">SciPy</a> and offers data
                mining and analytics using classical ML algorithms.

                deep learning capabilities help to define and run
                computations involving tensors that have broad
                applications in Speech and image recognition, Text-based
                applications, Time-Series analysis and Video Detection.
                <a href="https://pytorch.org">PyTorch </a> is another deep
                learning library that is very popular among researchers for
                computer vision and NLP applications. <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet">MXNet</a>
                is another AI package that provides blueprints and
                templates for deep learning.
