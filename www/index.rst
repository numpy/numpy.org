NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
It contains among other things:

- a powerful N-dimensional array object
- sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
- tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
- useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient
multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be
defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide
variety of databases.

NumPy is licensed under the :ref:`BSD license <license>`, enabling reuse with
few restrictions.

Getting Started
---------------

To install NumPy, we strongly recommend using a
*scientific Python distribution*.  See
`Installing the SciPy Stack <https://www.scipy.org/install.html>`__ for
details.

Many high quality online tutorials, courses, and books are available to get
started with NumPy. For a quick introduction to NumPy we provide the
`NumPy Tutorial <https://www.numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html>`__. We
also recommend the `SciPy Lecture Notes <https://scipy-lectures.org>`__ for a
broader introduction to the scientific Python ecosystem.

For more information on the SciPy Stack (for which NumPy provides the
fundamental array data structure), see `scipy.org <https://www.scipy.org/>`__.

Documentation
-------------

The most up-to-date NumPy documentation can be found at
`Latest (development) version </devdocs>`__.
It includes a user guide, full reference documentation, a developer guide, and
meta information. 

Other links:

- `NumPy Enhancement Proposals <neps>`__ (which include the NumPy Roadmap and detailed
  plans for major new features).
- `NumPy verion 1.17 <1.17>`__
- `NumPy verion 1.16 <1.16>`__
- `NumPy verion 1.15 <1.15>`__
- `NumPy verion 1.14 <1.14>`__

.. 
    A complete archive of documentation for all NumPy releases (minor versions; bug
    fix releases don't contain significant documentation changes) since 2009 can be
    found at https://docs.scipy.org.

Support NumPy
-------------

If you have found NumPy to be useful in your work, research or company, please
consider making a donation to the project commensurate with your resources. Any
amount helps! All donations will be used strictly to fund the development of
NumPyâ€™s open source software, documentation and community.

Donations are managed by the NumFOCUS Foundation, which is the legal and fiscal
umbrella for the project. NumFOCUS is a 501(c)3 non-profit foundation, so if
you are subject to US Tax law, your contribution is tax-deductible.
NumPy's `Steering Council <https://www.numpy.org/devdocs/dev/governance/index.html>`__
will make the decisions on how to best use any funds received.  Technical and
infrastructure priorities are documented on the
`NumPy Roadmap <https://www.numpy.org/neps/roadmap.html>`__.
