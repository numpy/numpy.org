The NumPy community
-------------------

The community of NumPy users and developers is large and decentralized. We
try to direct certain conversations to certain channels.


1. Use the `#numpy tag on StackOverflow <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/numpy>`__
   for *usage* questions (like "How do I do *X* in NumPy?").
2. Use the `GitHub issue tracker <https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues>`__ for

   - **Bug reports** (like "``np.arange(3).shape`` returns ``(5,)``, when it should return ``(3,)``.")
   - **Documentation issues** (like "I found this section unclear")
   - **Feature requests** (like "I would like to have a new interpolation method in ``np.percentile``.")

3. Use the `NumPy mailing list <https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/numpy-discussion>`__
   for longer-form discussion items. This is for things that concern the
   broader NumPy community.  Most users probably don't care about an obscure
   edge-case in ``np.polynomial.Legendre`` (which  should be reported on the
   issue tracker), but may care about larger-picture things like

   - How should we have discussions about NumPy and the community?
   - Developing or adding items to a NumPy roadmap
   - Announcing sprints or conference talks
   - Changes to the development workflow
   - Announcements for NumPy releases and developer meetings
   - ...
