    features:
    - title: Powerful N-dimensional arrays
      icon: cartesian
      text: NumPy arrays are easy to use, versatile and fast. The NumPy vectorization, indexing and broadcasting concepts have become a standard way of thinking about array computing.
    - title: Numerical computing tools
      icon: chip
      text: Mathematical functions, random number generators, linear algebra routines, Fourier transforms, and more.
    - title: Interoperable
      icon: computer
      text: NumPy supports a wide range of computing platforms. If your data fits in memory and your code runs on a CPU, NumPy is for you! And if you need GPU, distributed or sparse arrays, NumPy works well with all the major libraries that provide that.
    - title: Open source
      icon: web-programming
      text: NumPy is free for everyone to use, publicly developed on GitHub by a diverse community, and distributed under a liberal BSD license.
