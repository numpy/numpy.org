## FIX: Removed so we can use new version of lighthouse
##  ‚ùØ Outdated plugins
##    - @netlify/plugin-lighthouse@2.1.3: latest version is 3.2.0
##      To upgrade this plugin, please remove it from "netlify.toml" and
##      install it from the Netlify plugins directory instead (https://app.netlify.com/plugins)
